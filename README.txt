This is a sample CMS i was doing for a customer, but they decided to stop the project, so it's actually not completed.
The only really missing part is the configuration of the login form, the authentication. Actually if you want to use it you can simply change the path of the controllers using some kind of 'folder password' mechanism. Like, from /page/index to /thisisapassword/page/index .


By using this software, you implicitly accept the licenses for : bootstrap, fontawesome, jquery and summernote.

This software is released with the MIT license. The license only covers the code actually written by me.
